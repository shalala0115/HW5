  WhatsApp, which is owned by Facebook, said the attack targeted a "select number" of users and was orchestrated by "an advanced cyber-actor".

  A fix was rolled out on Friday.

  On Monday, WhatsApp urged all of its 1.5 billion users to update their apps as an added precaution.

  The surveillance software involved was developed by Israeli firm NSO Group, according to a report in the Financial Times.

  Facebook first discovered the flaw in WhatsApp earlier in May.

  Global stock markets have steadied amid hopes that the US and China will resume talks next month, following an escalation in their trade war.

On Monday, China announced tit-for-tat tariffs on $60bn (£46bn) of US exports, causing stock markets to tumble

But later US President Donald Trump said he expected to meet China's president at the G20 summit in Japan.

He also said he had not decided whether to go ahead with threatened tariffs on another $325bn of Chinese imports.

At a briefing on Tuesday, China's foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said: "The two heads of state maintain contact through various means."

  Former US President Jimmy Carter has undergone surgery for a broken hip after falling at his home in Georgia, his office says.

The 94-year-old, the oldest living former US president, was on his way to go turkey hunting when he fell.

Mr Carter was recovering comfortably at a medical centre in Americus, near his home in Plains, with his wife, Rosalynn, a statement said.

His surgeon was quoted as saying that the operation was successful.

A Democrat from Georgia, Mr Carter was a relative unknown in the US political world when he was elected president in 1976. He served from 1977 to 1981.

"President Carter said his main concern is that turkey season ends this week, and he has not reached his limit. He hopes the State of Georgia will allow him to rollover the unused limit to next year," the Carter Center said.

  A group of US consumers has been given the go-ahead by the Supreme Court to sue Apple over app prices.

The iPhone users argued that there is no alternative place to buy an iPhone app, but that Apple takes a 30% commission on every sale, so therefore they are being overcharged.

They claim that this puts Apple in breach of anti-trust laws.

Apple said that it was an agent for app developers and that it neither owned nor sold the apps itself.

However, while app developers set their own prices, Apple collects the payments.

  Hollywood legend Doris Day, whose films made her one of the biggest stars of all time, has died aged 97.

The singer turned actress starred in films such as Calamity Jane and Pillow Talk and had a hit in 1956 with Que Sera, Sera (Whatever Will Be, Will Be).

Her screen partnership with Rock Hudson is one of the best-known in the history of romantic movies.

In a statement, the Doris Day Animal Foundation said she died on Monday at her home in Carmel Valley, California.
It said she had been "in excellent physical health for her age, until recently contracting a serious case of pneumonia".

"She was surrounded by a few close friends as she passed," the statement continued.
